{0 ocamlclose}

[ocamlclose] is an application to detect and transform [open M] statements in
OCaml source code, in order to make the overall source more legible.

You can read more about its usage on its 
{{: https://github.com/tweag/ocaml-close} Github} page.

The application is only a thin wrapper around the {!module:Closelib} library,
which is documented here.
