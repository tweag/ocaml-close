; Determines what is the considered the optimal placement of a global open.
; Either:
;   - 'pos':   the position before the first actual use of the open is optimal
;   - 'scope': the beginning of the smallest enclosing module of all the uses is
;              optimal
(placement scope)

; The order in which rules are matched
; (e.g., we keep opens matched by the 'keep' rule no matter the other rules)
(precedence (keep remove local structure move))

; List of opens that are never ever touched, considered "standard".
